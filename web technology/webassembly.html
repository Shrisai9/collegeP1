    <p>
      WebAssembly is a high-performance assembly-like language that can be
      compiled from various languages, including C/C++, Rust, and
      AssemblyScript. Currently, it is supported by Chrome, Firefox, Safari,
      Edge, and Node.js!
    </p>

    <p>
      The WebAssembly specification details two file formats, a binary format
      called a WebAssembly Module with a .wasm extension and corresponding text
      representation called WebAssembly Text format with a .wat extension.
    </p>

    <p>Key Concepts</p>
    <p>Module - A compiled WebAssembly binary, ie a .wasm file.</p>
    <p>Memory - A resizable ArrayBuffer.</p>
    <p>Table - A resizable typed array of references not stored in Memory.</p>
    <p>
      Instance - An instantiation of a Module with its Memory, Table, and
      variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to use WebAssembly, you need a .wasm binary file and a set of
      APIs to communicate with WebAssembly. Node.js provides the necessary APIs
      via the global WebAssembly object.
