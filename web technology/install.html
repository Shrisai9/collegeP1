      Node.js can be installed in different ways. This post highlights the most
      common and convenient ones. Official packages for all the major platforms
      are available at https://nodejs.org/download/.

    <p>
      One very convenient way to install Node.js is through a package manager.
      In this case, every operating system has its own. Other package managers
      for MacOS, Linux, and Windows are listed in
      https://nodejs.org/download/package-manager/

      nvm is a popular way to run Node.js. It allows you to easily switch the
      Node.js version, and install new versions to try and easily rollback if
      something breaks. It is also very useful to test your code with old
      Node.js versions.
    </p>

    <p>
      See https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm for more information about this option.

      In any case, when Node.js is installed you'll have access to the node
      executable program in the command line.
