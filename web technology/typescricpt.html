    <p>What is TypeScript</p>
    <p>
      TypeScript is a trendy open-source language maintained and developed by
      Microsoft. It's loved and used by a lot of software developers around the
      world.

      asically, it's a superset of JavaScript that adds new capabilities to the
      language. The most notable addition is static type definitions, something
      that is not present in plain JavaScript. Thanks to types, it's possible,
      for example, to declare what kind of arguments we are expecting and what
      is returned exactly in our functions or what's the exact shape of the
      object that we are creating. TypeScript is a really powerful tool and
      opens a new world of possibilities in JavaScript projects. It makes our
      code more secure and robust by preventing many bugs before the code is
      even shipped - it catches problems during code development and integrates
      wonderfully with code editors like Visual Studio Code.
