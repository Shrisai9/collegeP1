    <p>Enable Inspector</p>
    <p>
      When started with the --inspect switch, a Node.js process listens for a
      debugging client. By default, it will listen at host and port
      127.0.0.1:9229. Each process is also assigned a unique UUID.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inspector clients must know and specify host address, port, and UUID to
      connect. A full URL will look something like
      ws://127.0.0.1:9229/0f2c936f-b1cd-4ac9-aab3-f63b0f33d55e.
    </p>

    <p>
      Node.js will also start listening for debugging messages if it receives a
      SIGUSR1 signal. (SIGUSR1 is not available on Windows.) In Node.js 7 and
      earlier, this activates the legacy Debugger API. In Node.js 8 and later,
      it will activate the Inspector API.
    </p>

    <p>Security Implications</p>
    <p>
      Since the debugger has full access to the Node.js execution environment, a
      malicious actor able to connect to this port may be able to execute
      arbitrary code on behalf of the Node.js process. It is important to
      understand the security implications of exposing the debugger port on
      public and private networks.
    </p>

    <p>Exposing the debug port publicly is unsafe</p>
    <p>
      If the debugger is bound to a public IP address, or to 0.0.0.0, any
      clients that can reach your IP address will be able to connect to the
      debugger without any restriction and will be able to run arbitrary code.
    </p>

    <p>
      By default node --inspect binds to 127.0.0.1. You explicitly need to
      provide a public IP address or 0.0.0.0, etc., if you intend to allow
      external connections to the debugger. Doing so may expose you to a
      potentially significant security threat. We suggest you ensure appropriate
      firewalls and access controls in place to prevent a security exposure.
    </p>

    <p>
      See the section on 'Enabling remote debugging scenarios' on some advice on
      how to safely allow remote debugger clients to connect.
    </p>

    <p>Local applications have full access to the inspector</p>
    <p>
      if you bind the inspector port to 127.0.0.1 (the default), any
      applications running locally on your machine will have unrestricted
      access. This is by design to allow local debuggers to be able to attach
      conveniently.
    </p>

    <p>Browsers, WebSockets and same-origin policy</p>
    <p>
      Websites open in a web-browser can make WebSocket and HTTP requests under
      the browser security model. An initial HTTP connection is necessary to
      obtain a unique debugger session id. The same-origin-policy prevents
      websites from being able to make this HTTP connection. For additional
      security against DNS rebinding attacks, Node.js verifies that the 'Host'
      headers for the connection either specify an IP address or localhost
      precisely.
    </p>

    <p>
      These security policies disallow connecting to a remote debug server by
      specifying the hostname. You can work-around this restriction by
      specifying either the IP address or by using ssh tunnels as described
      below.
